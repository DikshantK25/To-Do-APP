# To-Do List App

A simple, responsive, and user-friendly To-Do List App that lets you add, mark as completed, and delete tasks. Your tasks are saved locally in your browser, so your list stays intact even after refreshing the page.

## Features

- **Add Tasks:** Easily add new tasks by typing into the input box and clicking "Add".
- **Mark Tasks as Completed:** Click on a task to toggle its completed state (with a striking effect).
- **Delete Tasks:** Remove tasks by clicking on the "×" icon next to them.
- **Persistent Data:** Tasks are stored in your browser's local storage so that your list remains available between sessions.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5:** Structure of the application.
- **CSS3:** Styling and layout.
- **JavaScript (ES6):** Functionality and local storage integration.
- **Local Storage API:** Saves your tasks for persistent data.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository or Download the ZIP:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DikshantK25/To-Do-APP.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Folder:**

   ```bash
   cd To-Do-APP
   ```

3. **Open `index.html` in Your Browser:**

   - You can open the file directly in your browser.
   - Alternatively, use a live server (e.g., via VS Code's Live Server extension) for a better development experience.

## Usage

- **Adding a Task:**  
  Type your task into the input box and click the **Add** button.
  
- **Marking a Task as Completed:**  
  Click on any task (the list item) to toggle its completion status. Completed tasks will have a strike-through effect and a different icon.
  
- **Deleting a Task:**  
  Click the **×** icon next to a task to remove it from the list.

Your tasks will be automatically saved to local storage and reloaded when you revisit or refresh the page.
